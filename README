    This is an implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life written in C.
This program makes use of the SDL (Simple Directmedia Library)
to provide a cross-platform graphical frontend for this
application.

==== HOW TO PLAY ====
    This game offers a handful of features to make playing more fun and
interactive. The features, as well as the action to initiate them are:

    Note that I am obviously not the initial creator of the Game of Life,
and that all credits for having invented it go to John Horton Conway
himself for that. I also do not own any portion of the SDL.

    This program is free and open source software and you are welcome to
download, use, modify, and distribute it under the terms of the GPL.

    Note that, under Windows, you may wish to use MSys with MinGW in order
to compile this program using the Makefile provided. You will also need
to manually install the SDL.  For *nix users, you should be able to 
simply run make on the Makefile immediately as most distributions come
with make built in.  To get the SDL, you may (under Linux) simply have
to run the command to install (via your package manager) libsdl1.2-dev.

    Special thanks to LAMMJohnson, the most knowledgeable person on /g/, 
for a TON of fantastic help.  He provided me with some fantastic feedback
and support that made the project a whole lot more rewarding!
